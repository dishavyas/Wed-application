	<h1 class="animate__animated animate__heartBeat animate__infinite style="text-align: center;">History Of Coffee</h1>
	<p style="text-align: center;">Evidence of knowledge of the coffee tree and coffee drinking first appeared in the late 15th century; Sufi Imam Muhammad Ibn Said Al Dhabhani is known to have imported goods from Ethiopia to Yemen. Coffee was first exported out of Ethiopia to Yemen by Somali merchants from Berbera and Zeila, which was procured from Harar and the Abyssinian interior. According to Captain Haines, who was the colonial administrator of Aden (1839-1854), Mocha historically imported up to two-thirds of their coffee from Berbera-based merchants before the coffee trade of Mocha was captured by British-controlled Aden in the 19th century. Thereafter, much of the Ethiopian coffee was exported to Aden via Berbera.

		"Berbera not only supplies Aden with horned cattle and sheep to a very large extent, but the trade between Africa and Aden is steadily increasing greatly every year. In the article of coffee alone there is considerable export, and ' Berbera' coffee stands in the Bombay market now before Mocha. The coffee shipped at Berbera comes from far in the interior from Hurrar, Abyssinia, and Kaffa. It will be to the advantage of all that the trade should come to Aden through one port, and Berbera is the only place on the coast there that has a protected port, where vessels can lie in smooth water.”</p>

	<p style="text-align: center;">Coffee has been shown to have direct benefits on patients with Parkinson’s disease and asthma. Here we look at the evidence that helps illustrate just how.

		Several large population studies show a promising relationship between coffee consumption and reduced risk of Parkinson’s disease. Men who did not drink coffee had a three to five times higher risk of developing Parkinson’s disease in the next 24 to 30 years, as compared to those who drank at least 28 ounces a day. Men in the one study who drank at least one cup of coffee a day reduced their risk of developing Parkinson’s disease by 50% in the next 10 years, as compared to those who drank no coffee at all.</p>
